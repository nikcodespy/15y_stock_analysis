üìä Exploratory Data Analysis: 15-Year Tech Stock Trends

This document summarises the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) I performed using MySQL on historical stock data from 2010 to 2024 for five major tech companies: AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, and NVDA.

üîç What I Did

Using beginner-friendly SQL queries, I explored long-term performance, average closing prices, volatility, and consistency across five major tech stocks. The dataset was cleaned and transformed into a long format with columns for Date, Ticker, Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume.

‚ùì Questions I Answered

‚úÖ Q1: Which company delivered the highest return from 2010 to 2024?

Solved by: Calculating the percentage change between the first and last closing price.

Result:
AAPL had the highest return at 3784%
Followed by AMZN (~3177%) and NVDA (~3158%)
